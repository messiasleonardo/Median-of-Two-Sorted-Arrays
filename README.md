# Median-of-Two-Sorted-Arrays
Resolving the problem website LeetCode, name Median-of-Two-Sorted-Arrays

## Problem
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

## Examples
Example 1:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2.00000
<strong>Explanation:</strong> merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
</pre>

Example 2:
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2.50000
<strong>Explanation:</strong> merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
</pre>
